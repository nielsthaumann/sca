Spike density component analysis decomposes EEG or MEG waveforms into neural components 
modelled with temporal probability density functions.

This version runs in the Matlab environment and requires the FieldTrip toolbox to be installed (see https://github.com/fieldtrip). 
'Runsca' also requires the Curve Fitting Toolbox to be installed for Gaussian or sine models. 
For experimental comparison with gamma models, the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox needs to be installed.
